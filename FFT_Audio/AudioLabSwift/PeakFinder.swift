     Get array of peak frequencies in an fft. Optional low and high cutoff frequencies
     (fl and fh) for doppler
     
     Examples:
    
         // get peaks over entire fft
        getPeaks(withFl: nil, withFh: nil)
     
        // get peaks from low frequency (500Hz) onwards (inclusive)
        getPeaks(withFl: 500, withFh: nil)
     
        // get peaks up to high frequency (500Hz) (inclusive)
        getPeaks(withFl: nil, withFh: 500)
     
        // get peaks between low frequency (500Hz) and high frequency (1KHz) (inclusive on both)
        getPeaks(withFl: 500, withFh: 1000)
     
     With the low and high cuttoff, we can just threshold for Doppler shifts.  Basically make a
     decision when the max value in the returned array is above/below a threshold.  These peaks
     are returned in descending order of their magnitudes.
